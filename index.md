# Welcome to CUWiP-NYC 2018

# APS CUWiP at Columbia University, Barnard College, and City College of New York #

## What is CUWiP?

On the weekend of January 12-14, 2018, Columbia University, Barnard College, and City College of New York will host the APS Conferences for Undergraduate Women in Physics (CUWiP) for the metropolitan New York region. CUWiP conferences are regional conferences for undergraduate physics majors.  The APS CUWiP goal is to help undergraduate women continue in physics by providing them with the opportunity to experience a professional conference, information about graduate school and professions in physics, and access to other women in physics of all ages with whom they can share experiences, advice, and ideas. <a href="http://www.aps.org/programs/women/workshops/upload/CUWiP_2018-Poster_web.pdf"> APS CUWiP Conference Flyer</a>
